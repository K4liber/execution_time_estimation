\section{Algorithm}

As a machine learning algorithm for our project we will use \textit{Epsilon-Support Vector Regression}\cite{svrc} (SVR) - it is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM, orginally named \textit{support-vector networks}\cite{svm}).

We will use SVR model with a RBF kernel\cite{rbf_kernel} which is the most known flexible kernel and it could project the features vectors into infinite dimensions. It uses Taylor expansion which is equivalent to use an infinite sum over the polynomial kernels. It allows to model any function that is a sum of uknown degree polynomials.
